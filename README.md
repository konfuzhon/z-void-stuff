## How to download the repo
Start by creating an organized set of directories for storing git projects:
(Do not copy and paste the following lines one-by-one. Click the copy button.)
```bash
cd ~ &&
mkdir .git && cd .git &&
mkdir clones && cd clones 
```
Now that you are in the proper directory, you can clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/konfuzhon/z-void-stuff
```

## How to update it
After you've cloned a repo, it will not automatically update with new commits made
to the owner's copy. Therefore, to keep this cloned repo up to date with the original,
enter the following:
```bash
cd ~/.git/clones/z-void-stuff/
```
```bash
git pull origin main
```
